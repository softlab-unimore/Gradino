After that, define the table attributes, the types of the attributes and the range of values allowed.
In particular, only one column can contain float values. The other columns must contain categorical values.
The number of attributes (number of columns) must be exactly equal to {num_columns}.
The table must be pivoted later, so create a table that can tolerate pivot operations and still be meaningful. Make the table "real", using real entities while avoiding placeholders.

First reason step-by-step. Then write "Final answer: " followed exclusively by a Python dictionary exactly like the following:

{{
    "name": ..., # name of the table
    "attributes": ..., # list containing the names of the attributes. The names must not have whitespaces.
    "attribute_types": ..., # list containing the types of the attributes. the length of this list must be equal to the length of the "attributes" list. The type can either be "float", "int" or "categorical". Also numerical values (like years) can be categorical.
    "range": ..., # this list must have the same length as "attributes" and "attribute_types". for categorical attributes it is a list containing all the possible values. For possibly float and int values it is a list containing, at the first position, the start of the range and at the second position the end of the range.
    "value_col": ..., # string indicating the attribute name of the column to pivot later. This attribute must either be "int" or "float"
